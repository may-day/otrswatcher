OTRS watcher
============

What
----

This is a firefox add-on that displays the number of tickets in your OTRS' queue
along with the number of your locked, watched and responsible tickets.


Why
---

I was annoyed to regulary switch to the tab containing the OTRS site.
Keeping an eye on the numbers in the statusbar seemed more convenient.

How
---

This plugin simply uses the services that are provided by the iPhoneBundle.
So you need that installed on your OTRS site.
