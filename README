OTRS watcher
============

What
----

This is a firefox add-on that displays the number of tickets in your OTRS' queue
along with the number of your locked, watched and responsible tickets.


Why
---

I was annoyed to regulary switch to the tab containing the OTRS site.
Keeping an eye on the numbers in the statusbar seemed more convenient.

How
---

This plugin simply uses the services that are provided by the iPhoneHandle.
So you need that installed on your OTRS site.


Clientside
----------

I only test it against my current setup. 
That is Firefox 3.6.

Serverside
----------

You need an account to an otrs backend!
Your otrs needs the iPhoneHandle package installed.
Currently i only tested it against otrs 2.4.9 with iPhoneHandle 0.9.6.


All by myself?
--------------
Ha, certainly not!
I read a bit nagioschecker's code.
Also the stockwatcher sample on mozilla's developer site was quite helpful.
All bugs are mine of course.
